# Operation-Decode
#### Project by Matin Akbari & Enoch Morris

Welcome to your new positions, spies! This is your boss speaking!
You shall be using this Java-based encryption/decryption software in order to contact your fellow spies and subordinates.
This program is dubbed, "Operation-Decode". Operation-Decode will take highly sensitive secret messages and a number password to encrypt the messages into a secret cipher.
The program will then be used again to decrypt the cipher.

**BUT BEWARE, if you have the correct encrypted secret message, but the incorrect password, you will not be able to decipher it!**

Here are the instructions to use the software:
####Encyrption Instructions (Spy 1) :
1. Open and run the software.
2. You will see that the first output asks for your message, input the message and press enter.
3. Secondly, it will ask to set a password for your message, using any integer of choice greater than zero, once given, press enter again.
4. Proceed to receive your encoded message. NOTE: When the message is encrypted, copy it with the spaces before and after the message.

**Make sure you share the password with the spy you plan to give the message to, for the password is not given again in the program.**

####Decryption Instructions (Spy 2):
1. Run the software again.
2. This time, paste the encoded message with the given spaces in step 4 and press enter.
3. Enter in the password received from Spy 1 and press enter.
4. Receive the decrypted secret message.
