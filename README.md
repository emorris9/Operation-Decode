# Operation-Decode
### Project by Matin Akbari & Enoch Morris

Welcome to your new positions, spies! This is your boss speaking!
You shall be using this Java-based encryption/decryption software in order to contact your fellow spies and subordinates.
This program is dubbed, "Operation-Decode". Operation-Decode will take highly sensitive secret messages and a number pass code to encrypt the messages into a secret cipher.
The program will then be used again to decrypt the cipher.

**BUT BEWARE, if you have the correct encrypted secret message, but the incorrect pass code, you will not be able to decipher it!**

Here are the instructions to use the software:

#### Encryption Instructions (Spy 1):
1. Open and run the software.
2. You will see that the first output asks for your message, input the message and press enter.
3. Secondly, it will ask to set a pass code for your message, using any integer of choice greater than zero, once given, press enter again.
4. Proceed to receive your encoded message. NOTE: When the message is encrypted, copy it with the spaces before and after the message.

**Make sure you share the pass code with the spy you plan to give the message to, for it is not given again within the program.**

#### Decryption Instructions (Spy 2):
1. Run the software again.
2. This time, paste the encoded message with the given spaces in step 4 and press enter.
3. Enter in the pass code received from Spy 1 and press enter.
4. Receive the decrypted secret message.
